# Tabby Infrastructure Research & Implementation Notes

## Background Research

### Similar Solutions Evaluated

#### 1. **Bastion Host Solutions**
- **Teleport**: Enterprise SSH gateway with web UI
  - ✅ Pros: Audit logs, RBAC, session recording
  - ❌ Cons: Heavy, enterprise-focused, complex setup
  - **Decision**: Too heavy for personal use

- **Pritunl Zero**: Zero-trust SSH gateway
  - ✅ Pros: Modern security model
  - ❌ Cons: Requires infrastructure changes
  - **Decision**: Overkill for personal setup

#### 2. **Web Terminal Solutions**
- **ttyd**: Simple web terminal
  - ✅ Pros: Lightweight, easy setup
  - ❌ Cons: No session management, basic features
  - **Decision**: Too simple

- **Wetty**: Web + TTY
  - ✅ Pros: SSH over WebSockets
  - ❌ Cons: Limited configuration sync
  - **Decision**: Missing key features

- **Guacamole**: Clientless remote desktop
  - ✅ Pros: Multi-protocol (SSH, RDP, VNC)
  - ❌ Cons: Java-based, resource heavy
  - **Decision**: Over-engineered for terminal needs

### Why Tabby Gateway?

After researching alternatives, Tabby Gateway provides the ideal balance:

1. **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage vs enterprise solutions
2. **Integrated**: Native integration with Tabby.sh desktop app
3. **Flexible**: Supports both desktop and web access
4. **Manageable**: Simple configuration via scripts
5. **Secure**: Provides necessary security without complexity

## Implementation Decisions

### Architecture Choices

#### Gateway as Jump Host
```
Traditional:  Client → SSH → Server (direct)
Our Setup:    Client → Gateway → Server (proxied)
```

**Benefits**:
- Single point for authentication
- Connection pooling and reuse
- Centralized logging
- Easy firewall management

#### Configuration via Gists
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Git repo: Too heavy, needs clone/pull
- S3/Cloud storage: Requires cloud account
- Local sync: No remote access

**Gist Benefits**:
- Simple API
- Version history
- Private by default
- Accessible to support (Claude)

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Choice (Tabby Web)
- **SQLite**: Chosen for simplicity
- Backup strategy: Full DB dumps to gist
- No need for PostgreSQL/MySQL complexity

#### Security Model
```
1. SSH Keys:     Managed by Tabby, stored encrypted
2. Gateway Auth: Certificate-based with renewal
3. Web Auth:     Token-based with expiration
4. Gist Sync:    OAuth tokens in ~/.env_tokens
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Connection Multiplexing
```bash
# SSH config for gateway
Host tabby-gateway
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm_%r@%h:%p
    ControlPersist 10m
```

### Resource Management
- Gateway runs with systemd resource limits
- Connection pooling reduces overhead
- SQLite WAL mode for concurrent access

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus endpoints
2. **Multi-Gateway**: Failover support
3. **Session Recording**: Async recording to gist
4. **Mobile App**: Native iOS/Android clients

### Rejected Features
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Too complex
- **LDAP/AD Support**: Not needed for personal use
- **Multi-tenancy**: Single-user focused

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Gist-based sync**: Simple and reliable
2. **Script automation**: Easy maintenance
3. **Modular design**: Can disable components

### Challenges Faced
1. **Initial Setup**: Required careful firewall config
2. **Token Management**: Solved with ~/.env_tokens
3. **Backup Scheduling**: Automated with cron

## Integration Research

### Shell Integration
- Tested with bash, zsh, fish
- Auto-detection of available shells
- Fallback mechanisms implemented

### Terminal Features
- Color support: Full 24-bit color
- Unicode: UTF-8 throughout
- Mouse: Supporting modern TUIs

## Security Research

### Threat Model
1. **External Access**: Gateway limits exposure
2. **Credential Theft**: Encrypted storage
3. **Session Hijacking**: Token rotation
4. **Man-in-Middle**: Certificate pinning

### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular security updates via mise
- Automated certificate renewal
- Audit logging to separate gist
- Fail2ban integration on gateway
